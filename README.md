How to develop web apps on Ethereum with Solidity, TestRPC and Web3.js.

 


    Install node.js.
    testrpc: to install globally, in Terminal, run "npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc". After the installation, run "testrpc", this will generate 10 test accounts pre-funded with 100 ether.
    In Terminal, open new window and run "npm init" to initialize the project and create a "package.json" file.
    web3.js: “npm install web3 —save”. It installs Web3 library and saves it into the "package.json" file.
